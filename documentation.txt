# Video ASL Recognition Project Documentation

## Project Setup (Current Date)

### Repository Initialization
- Created GitHub repository for version control and collaboration
- Established initial project structure
- Added README.md with project overview and basic instructions

### Environment Configuration
- Created testcuda.py to verify GPU availability for deep learning tasks
- Implemented CUDA detection and system information reporting
- Set up requirements.txt with necessary dependencies for reproducibility

### Project Planning
- Developed comprehensive pipeline.txt outlining the project workflow
- Identified key components for ASL recognition system:
  - Pose estimation (MediaPipe/OpenPose)
  - Keypoint extraction and preprocessing
  - Sequential data handling
  - Model architecture planning (RNN/LSTM)
  - Real-time inference considerations

### Technical Decisions
- Selected PyTorch as the primary deep learning framework
- Decided to focus on hand and upper body keypoints for ASL recognition
- Planned for potential multi-modal approach combining visual and pose features
- Prioritized performance optimization for real-time recognition capability

## Dataset Integration (Updated Date)

### WLASL Dataset Organization
- Created dedicated pose_estimation folder structure for ASL recognition module
- Set up directory hierarchy for source code and data organization
- Created scripts to clone and integrate with official WLASL repository
- Added support for WLASL100, WLASL300, and WLASL1000 dataset splits

### Data Management Configuration
- Implemented .gitignore file to exclude large data files from version control
- Set up system for leveraging existing WLASL preprocessing code
- Created documentation for pose estimation module in README.md
- Established data flow from raw videos to pose keypoints

### Integration with Official Implementation
- Created setup scripts to automate repository cloning and file organization
- Configured system to reuse official video downloading and preprocessing code
- Designed data directory structure aligned with WLASL dataset organization
- Prepared environment for efficient dataset handling

## Pipeline Progress Update

With the integration of the WLASL repository, we have:
- ‚úÖ Initialized project structure and environment (Step 0)
- ‚è≥ Set up pose estimation framework structure (Step 1, in progress)
- üîÑ Prepared for keypoint extraction by leveraging WLASL preprocessing (Steps 2-4, infrastructure ready)
- üìù Defined clear path for subsequent model development (Steps 5-10, planned)

By reusing the official WLASL repository code, we will accelerate our development process, skipping much of the custom implementation that would otherwise be needed for video downloading and preprocessing. This allows us to focus more directly on the pose estimation and model development aspects of the project.

## Next Focus Areas
- Complete setup of pose estimation with MediaPipe/OpenPose
- Extract keypoints from WLASL video data
- Develop and train sequence models on keypoint data
- Implement and test real-time recognition capabilities

NOTE: This documentation will be periodically updated throughout the project development to maintain a comprehensive record for the final report.

## Update History
- Initial documentation created (Current Date)
- Dataset integration and pose estimation setup added (Updated Date)
