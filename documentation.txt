# Video ASL Recognition Project Documentation

## Project Setup (Current Date)

### Repository Initialization
- Created GitHub repository for version control and collaboration
- Established initial project structure
- Added README.md with project overview and basic instructions

### Environment Configuration
- Created testcuda.py to verify GPU availability for deep learning tasks
- Implemented CUDA detection and system information reporting
- Set up requirements.txt with necessary dependencies for reproducibility

### Project Planning
- Developed comprehensive pipeline.txt outlining the project workflow
- Identified key components for ASL recognition system:
  - Pose estimation (MediaPipe/OpenPose)
  - Keypoint extraction and preprocessing
  - Sequential data handling
  - Model architecture planning (RNN/LSTM)
  - Real-time inference considerations

### Technical Decisions
- Selected PyTorch as the primary deep learning framework
- Decided to focus on hand and upper body keypoints for ASL recognition
- Planned for potential multi-modal approach combining visual and pose features
- Prioritized performance optimization for real-time recognition capability

## Next Steps
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Implementation of pose estimation pipeline
- Feature extraction from keypoint data
- Model development and training
- Evaluation and performance optimization
