### Documentation for Progress So Far

#### 1. **Project Setup**

- **Git Setup**: Initialized a GitHub repository and created a separate branch for the sentence reconstruction module in collaboration with team members.
- **Clone WLASL**: Successfully cloned the WLASL repository to get access to dataset files and preprocessing scripts.

#### 2. **Dataset Preprocessing**

- **Downloading Data**: Implemented a script to download and preprocess WLASL data (specifically focusing on subsets like WLASL100).
- **Folder Setup**: The project folder structure has been adjusted to match the necessary paths for preprocessing and model integration.
- **Parsing JSON**: Loaded and parsed WLASL JSON files to extract ASL-style and English word pairs.

#### 3. **Model and Preprocessing Preparation**

- **PyTorch Setup**: Installed PyTorch and ensured compatibility for model training and inference.
- **Data Tokenization**: Started setting up preprocessing steps like tokenization for ASL and English sentences to create suitable inputs for a Seq2Seq model or rule-based system.

#### Next Steps:
- **Data Preprocessing Completion**: Finalize tokenization and sequence handling.
- **Start Sentence Reconstruction**: Develop the sentence generation model using either a rule-based or seq2seq approach.

This documentation captures the progress and foundational steps taken to set up the project for sentence reconstruction from ASL sequences.
