That would help me decide.
I need to change that bandage.
I don't need a table.
Tom left the book on the table.
I need your help clearing this table.
Don't go to all this trouble.

You tell me that all the time.
Now isn't the time.
You need to make time.
Tom was at the wrong place at the wrong time.
It's the right time.
It was before my time.
That'd be fine.
I'm sure it will all work out fine.
Tom has heard it all before.
It's never black and white.
It's not always black and white.
It's not black and white.
Something has to give.
Go on the offensive.
This is the right move.
I need help with this stuff.

Now, all I need is information.
This is no time to be stubborn.
We need time to mourn.
You're in no position to tell me what to do.
I'm going to give it a go.
Just let the woman go.
That medicine isn't going to help.
It doesn't help.
That was last year.
Now pull yourself together.
Let's meet up for a drink later.
Tom lost no time answering the letter.
I don't need a computer.
Change is in the air.
That's not how it was.
This is no time for jokes.
All we can do now is go on with our lives.
Now I'm going to tell you how it is.
They won't all be like this.
It's like this.
We can all do this.
Tell it to the cops.
Tom has no right to give me orders.
It was like that.
I can work with that.
I was cool with that.
We have plenty of time for all that.
That's quite all right.
It feels right.
That's the last of it.
Do what you want with it.
There's no need for it.
Just tell me how you want it.
That can't last.

What could it all mean?
Need I go on?
How did Tom's hearing go?
How many were there altogether?
How is this fair?

Well, what does that tell you?
Does that work for you?
What was in it for you?
What did happen to all that money?
What a blessing!
What a letdown!
They all went to bed.
I don't want to go to the dance.
That's what I like.
Take what you like.
I put the book on the table.
What we need is some more time.
I can tell that you want to go home.
We're all right here.
Everything's just like before.
It was a hot debate.
Everything is white.
It's now time to leave.
This is the same thing.
Let's go bowling.
It was all wrong.
That was all wrong.
Everything was wrong.
Tom realized what was wrong.
It was time for lunch.
There was no need to talk.
Let's go have a drink.
What I need is a drink.
Many people like our book.
Please give me that book.
I want to get to work.
This didn't work.
Tom was right after all.
It didn't work at all.
That won't do at all.
I want to play football.
What we need is a plan.
What I need is a loan.
It was dark by then.
Let's go on in.
Tom'll be all right soon.
Last year I was in Boston.
You're now free to go.
Tom didn't want to go.
I would like to go, too.
I know who to give it to.
That was a help.
They may need a doctor.
I need you to tell me how to do this.
There's no need to tell Tom about this.
This is a difficult time for all of us.
That man is dangerous.
That was a good hat.
Don't give up like that.
What I want to know is how did you do that.
I'll not forget that.
It was a hot night.
Well, that's all right.
What's right is right.
Tom had no idea how to do it.
Don't forget it.
Those are exactly what we want.
It was stiflingly hot.
Time is running short.
I want to walk with you.
We all want to go with you.
I'm a man now.
You really have to go now.
I ought to go now.
There's no danger now.
I'm on the phone right now.
We're all right now.
Tom's all right now.
Tell me about it now.
Tom didn't enjoy the play.
I need a change of scenery.

Do you want to go with us?
What was it like in those days?
What language was that?
How cool is that?
What kind of dog is it?

What happened to all that money?
There are many pictures in this book.
Let go of the dog.
I like the Kurdish language.
Do I need to book a seat?
She is as tall as her mother.
This book is Paolo's.
Now I go to the market.
Who can choose?
Man is water.
What or who is at fault?
Who or what has the blame?

What time did that occur?
What time did that take place?
The water was hot.
This tall man is Mr Smith.
I would like white chocolate.
What color do you like?
What was the last station?

I'd like a taxi now.
This city has many wide avenues.

I'd like to go faster.
I need the work.
Do not forget the accusative!
I have no idea what this is.
I think I'm fine right now.
Is Tom the right man for Mary?
The train arrived right on time.
I'd like to forget it all.
I didn't like that at all.
I can't tell what this is.
How did Tom pull that off?
The skeptics were right.
I go there all the time.
I don't want to eat now.
It's time for Tom to go.
What is the time there?
What Tom did is wrong.
What color is the bird?
She imagined what life in the city would be like.
There's a book, a pencil, and a sheet of paper on the table.

At school.
All the best with that.

Be right there.
For how long?
No charge.

Fresh paint.
Yes, of course!
How peaceful!

How stupid!
It's the same.

Walk.
You have to wait for the right time to pull the switch.
What time are you planning to meet Tom?
Mine is black.
In the room, it is dark.
A bird flies.
I was in Boston last year.

Your go.
What is a meteor?
The food is on the table.
How many are left?
They want to go abroad.
I work with a computer.
What a tall mountain!
Snow is white, but soot is black.
Languages change over time.
It's all gone now.
Paper is white; carbon is black.
Snow is white, soot is black.
Life is like that.
Want to go for a ride?
That's all it was.
She's in consultation with the doctor right now.
It is not right to steal.
What is it, darling?

The book is open.
Let's all go home now.

Go outside and play.
You're like an old woman.
How was last weekend?
This is what Tom would do.
Tom is a dedicated family man.
We can do all of that.
That was the wrong answer.
This is what I want to do.
What is the biggest city in Georgia?
What is the largest city in Michigan?
This is what it's all about.
We all need to do more.
There are no fish in this lake.
Don't forget to tell Tom that.

I have no idea who did that.
What's wrong with all of you?
No one will ever forget this.
It was time to go to work.

Now something is really wrong.
That's not the same.
Tom will walk to school tomorrow.
I'm all right with that.
Tom didn't study at all.
What did Tom want to do?

The school is on a hill.
They are right.
He who doesn't work has nothing to eat.
I work on the computer all day.
That transcription is wrong.
Dance in the rain!
I don't really want anything to eat right now.
What did you do last year on Christmas Day?
What does your family eat for Christmas dinner?
What is this? This is a table.
What is this? This is a chair.
What is this? This is a man.
Thanks, that is all.
We don't have time to look for that right now.
Go to the top!
You came at the right time.
Now, the last sprint begins.
We don't have time to do that right now.
This is not fish.
They have no right to be here at this time.
What kind of fish do you like to eat?
I want people who are able to work.
You knew full well what was right.
Would it be all right if I talked?

You need to play by the rules.
We want nothing short of that.
We intend to right that wrong.
That's starting to change now.
Let's help those most in need.
It's time to change direction.
Is this what you want as well?
What would Tom want in return?
I feel like garbage right now.
Tom will finish this up later.
What you're feeling is wrong.
What would you want for them?
What would be the motivation?
No need to be bothered, brother.
Do not eat hastily.
This is no time to be a hero.
The school year ends in June.

Now that will be interesting.
I didn't have that last year.
Cool slightly before serving.
Appreciate what you have now.
Who would tell us the truth?
What an extraordinary woman.
We have kids that need help.
This time, it was different.

They don't need to change.
Tom had to help Mary to bed.
The documentation is fine.
That's what it feels like.
That's how it all started.
People need the money now.
It was purely by accident.
It can be exhausting work.
Tom will be fine with that.
All it takes is hard work.
What can go wrong will go wrong.
Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.
Everything that can go wrong will go wrong.
Anything that can possibly go wrong, does.
If anything can go wrong, it will.
Murphy's law states that whatever can go wrong will go wrong.
Who doesn't want to work?
What you need is clarity.
What did your doctor say?
Tom is the champ right now.
We see this all the time.
Tom has no servants at all.
This is what I look like.
This is the same concept.
This is all about change.
This change was critical.
They're coming right now.
The computer was damaged.
That was an amazing play.
Programs like these help.

What a day.
Tom has a small black dog.
What was that last part?
What I need is leverage.
We were all ready to go.
We need to work on that.
Was that the right call?
This is like the movies.
I'd like to meet with Tom.
The school year is over.
The concept is the same.
That may need to change.
Tom won't play this year.
Life is great right now.
It won't work like that.
It was before your time.
It was a difficult time.
It was a different time.
It really was like that.
I see that all the time.
How would you like that?
How many of those exist?
All you need is agility.
All right, knock it off.
What more need be said?
What might change that?
We need to play better.
We just need to finish.
Time will be the judge.
This paper is pathetic.
The voters want change.
The courts will decide.
The answer would be no.
That's what I want now.
That was the last time.
Tom would go no further.
Tom worked all the time.
Nothing is an accident.
It's that time of year.
Is this the right time?
I want no part of this.
I want no part of that.
How quickly time flies.
How cool would that be?
Tom is a better man now.
Tom had no money at all.
Tom had died like a man.
What were the results?
Tom faints all the time.
What does that entail?
This article is wrong.
They just want change.
Tom was no help either.
No need to exploit it.
Maybe now is the time.
Last year was torture.
It was the wrong call.
It was the right call.
It happened last year.
How many are teachers?
How can this not work?
How can I help myself?
Tom had no plan at all.
Tom behaved like a man.
We had to work at it.
This is no different.
There's no wait time.
That would help also.
Maybe this will help.
What do you want for dinner?
It's all ready to go.
Is it right or wrong?
I still want to play.
How did that develop?
Has the work started?
Who has it affected?
Who does that leave?
What work do you do?
What was surprising?
We're like a family.
We need all of them.
Tom will do the same.
That's all past now.
That's all gone now.
Tom was a family man.
Our work starts now.
It was like torture.
It was a happy time.
I want to finish it.
I need to finish it.
I need a tissue now.
I like to go places.
How would that feel?
How about right now?
This book is boring.
They don't like to dance.
Who was the victim?
Time will fix this.
This seems to help.
This is what works.
This is like magic.
This is all stupid.
This is a computer.
Tom is in the wrong.
That's no accident.
Only time can tell.
Tom can change that.
It's time to do it.
It was all a farce.
It has all stopped.
I'm fine with this.
I'm fine with that.
I'm all for change.
The time is right.
The moon was full.
Move to the right.
It was all an act.
It does take time.
How can this work?
Go if you want to.
All things change.
Would it help me?
What if it leaks?
What can it hurt?
We're all for it.
We were all fine.
OK, let's go now.
Tom had it wrong.
Tom had it right.
Tom did the work.
Tom did the same.
Change is coming.
There's no work.
Tom must go now.
Men like to eat.
Who was better?
Tom does it all.
Tom has it all.
Change is hard.
I give water to the dog.
We need to finish what we started.
At what time are we leaving?
What time are we leaving?
What time will we leave?
Some employees like change.
All right, how about her?
We have to go sooner or later.
It did not last long at all.
It didn't last long at all.
All the cool kids are doing it.
How can people help us?
Tom's mother makes all his clothes.
All Tom's clothes are made by his mother.
This is really not the time.
We have to start right now.
Do it right or don't do it at all.
How would you like to meet Tom?
We need people like that.
I go to the same school as Tom.
I'll be back in no time.

I definitely want to help.
I have no desire to dance.
We all need love.

I can help you do that right now.
How was the skiing?
I'd like you to meet my son.
Go inside and help your mother.
Tom doesn't want to go to bed.
All you do is work.
I have no idea who that woman is.
What a difference a year makes.
Tom was right the first time.
All I do is work.
Tom likes to play basketball.
Remember last year.
Drink some cool freshwater.
I'm the doctor.
This is the magician's hat.

What is Romanticism?
I went last time. You two can go this time.
Move now.
It will be dark all at once.
I don't have the time to help you right now.
The same as always.
The same as usual.
We both work full time.
The broth is hot.
I'm broke right now.
How many are too many?
I need to go to school fast.
Let's go to school for now.
How can we help people?
Jamal has to go home now.
This is the last time I let you go.

That doesn't seem right at all.
I don't want to eat that.
That was a thrilling book.
What time did I tell you to come?
How long will this go on?
You need a short break.

Do you need help, buddy?
The meals were on time.
I'm deaf.
I'm last.
I'm wrong.
I was full.
I'm a cook.
I had a son.
I can change.
I did it all.

How many guards are there?
How much will it all cost?
Go in the house right now.
Go back in.

Let me go now.
How can you be proud of a man like that?
Everything is the same as before.
Everything's the same as before.
How would you like to work under those conditions?
I'd rather not eat right now.
How you did that was wrong.
Fadil was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
It was Fadil who did all of those acts.
Fadil was all in.
Fadil was the perfect family man.
Fadil said the right things all the time.
I enjoy that.
I need to eat.
I like it hot.
Fine, thanks!
How did you all decide that?

How do you tell the difference?
There was no need for us to do that.

There's no need for you to do that.
How much did you have to drink last night?
